                <h2>Passion for Technology</h2>
                <p>For as long as I can remember, my father was bringing home tools and gadgets from work, and I was breaking them. I've always had a hard time keeping my hands off of anything with a power button. I always sought to cultivate this interest, and it evolved into hobbies such as photography, video games, and astronomy. However, I never formally learned any coding in high school, and my experience with hardware repair stemmed from my summer job, working with my dad.</p>
                <p>I was never content with just one interest, and in my Junior year of high school I took a Survey of Mass Media class, in which I began to blend my love for photography with my interest in creative storytelling, and two years later I was a Film Production major at the Honors College at Miami-Dade College. I will always have a love for film, and in my year of cinematic study I learned many skills and fundamental principles which continue to serve me well with my photography, but in the summer after my freshman year I decided to switch my major and my career path towards my first love, technology. I became a Computer Science major and never looked back.</p>

            <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>After rushing to finish my Associate's degree at the Honors College, I transferred to the University of Florida to complete my Bachelor's degree. Once settled, I filled the holes in my schedule by adding a minor of business administration, as Economics was always another interest of mine. The last couple of years have been a whirlwind, but I have learned more than I could have possibly imagined. I am now proficient in several programming languages, including Java, C++, and MySQL, and have experience with designing and building custom applications for business. </p>
            <p>I competed in Engineering Competitions such as the Cuban Infrastructure Challenge, in which I designed a program that served as a functional concept model for a medical records database for Cuba. Last summer, I completed an internship for Game Changer tec, in which I designed and built a Java program that reads values from a MySQL table, generates thousands of data points, and writes those values into rows on another MySQL table, for use with a data mining and machine learning program called Weka.</p>

                        <p>Born and raised in Miami, my sports ties lie deep. I've been going to football games from before I knew what football was, I was a die-hard Heat fan since before it was cool, and the school I go to will never stop me from bleeding orange and green.</p>

                        <p>I still remember that Christmas morning when I woke up to my new GameBoy Color. From that moment on I would always love video games. They have evolved in my heart from a fun way to pass the time to the richest story-telling medium and the most engaging entertainment.</p>

                        <p>I've always been curious by nature, and when other kids wanted to be firemen and superheroes, I dreamed of wearing a lab coat and mixing chemicals together. My love for science is deeply rooted, and influences my every thought. I have recently picked up amateur astronomy, and I am always following the latest news.</p>
